                <h2> Skin Scanner </h2>
                <p>Just looking at the mirror, we do not get many ideas about the skin problems faced by us. For the
                    same reason, a special machine is needed. A skin scanner is often required to fully understand
                    what's happening to their skin. Used by most estheticians to conduct an initial examination of a
                    person's skin condition, a skin scanner relies on blacklight blue lamp technology to penetrate under
                    the skin's outer surface, exposing various conditions using fluorescent colors. By using this tool,
                    aestheticians can detect conditions such as sun exposure below the skin's surface, obstructed pores,
                    poor circulation, dehydrated skin, and much more.</p>
